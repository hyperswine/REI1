1 + 1 -- WRONG!
+ 1 1  -- RIGHT!

# No mutable variables
x = 5. # just assign once

If using let expressions

x = 5;
x = + x 1. # this shadows the previous x and creates a new binding. It does NOT modify the previous x.

NO DO BLOCKS.

There are no curried functions. Functions can be partially applied using _. at that position

There are no multi line comments.

No async/await. All IO is done in unsafe $ ... blocks and the actor model.

No side effects outside unsafe $ ... blocks.

Preconditions and Postconditions are the recommended way to do things.

There are hardly any key words except like case ... of ..., unsafe, and so on.

There is no "type" or "data" keyword. Everything is just functions and let expressions.

So a type is literally just defined like

User = Type $ User String Num String.

Pattern matching can be done in the head of function definitions or in case ... of ... expressions.

NO BUILT IN OPERATORS. Everything is prefix notation. Something like "+" is literally just an identifier for a function.
So + works like a prefix function. E.g. + 1 2
