I want to push more things to the runtime if possible. Without as much hardcoding or custom syntactic constructs. Pattern matching for example could just take your value that you want to match on, then for each branch, try to match the pattern tree to the value tree (given that those are what they are represented in). No real special things are required, just parse the patterns and constructors to some relatively clean AST and maybe flatten it a bit in memory (through array like encoding). For modules, notice how they are almost exactly the same as a record if you zoom out. You could essentially just have a record which itself could be a list or array, then point the data at the fields of the module. For multiple dispatch, use a dispatch/3 function - the dispatch function takes a function name, its args and a list of types. It then pattern matches on those list of types and calls the right function to handle it. How could the codebase be updated to be more like that
